Hello world! 

This is my log for [#100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4). I'm also a [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/ student, so I imagine a lot of what I'm up to will involve the assignments I'm working on there. 

To whit, today I need to finish the [Fun Bus](https://github.com/tommycollison/Preprocessing-II) assignment, working with CSS Pre-Processors and DRY (don't-repeat-yourself) code.

TC
